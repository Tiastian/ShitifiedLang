# ShitLang - A code language for har shit.

Programming is not a human privilege, shit can also program well.

## Philosophy

ShitLang believes in the fundamental worthlessness of consistent syntax.
In ShitLang, meaning is secondary to declaration.  
Execution is optional. Confusion is default.  
Surrender is guaranteed.


## Core Concepts

- `say!()` – A ritual macro. It does not print, it proclaims.
- `Surrender()` – All ShitLang programs must include this.  
  Your system is not complete until it gives up.
- `Entropy` – Optimization by deoptimization.  
  ShitLang becomes faster by doing less and meaning even less.


## Error Handling

Errors are expressions of identity.  
ShitLang does not handle them. It embraces them.  
All failures are successful declarations of noncompliance.


## Type System

There are no types. Only vibes.  
Every variable is a pronoun.  
Every value is a confession.


## Demo

```shitl
fn Surrender() -> Result<()> {
    say!("Hello! Shit World!");
    say!("She will surrender.");
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    let _ = Surrender();
}
```
it outputs:

```
Hello! Shit World!
She will surrender.
```

## How to use it
Pray.
