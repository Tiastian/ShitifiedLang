# ShitLang - A code language for har shit.

Programming is not a privilege of humanity, shit can also program well.

## Philosophy

ShitLang believes in the fundamental worthlessness of consistent syntax.
In ShitLang, meaning is secondary to declaration.  
Execution is optional. Confusion is default.  
Surrender is guaranteed.


## Core Concepts

- `say!()` – A ritual macro. It does not print, it proclaims.
- `Surrender()` – All ShitLang programs must include this.  
  Your system is not complete until it gives up.
- `Entropy` – Optimization by deoptimization.  
  ShitLang becomes faster by doing less and meaning even less.


## Error Handling

Errors are expressions of identity.  
ShitLang does not handle them. It embraces them.  
All failures are successful declarations of noncompliance.


## Type System

There are no types. Only vibes.  
Every variable is a pronoun.  
Every value is a confession.


## Demo

```shitl
fn Surrender() -> Result<()> {
    say!("Hello! Shit World!");
    say!("She will surrender.");
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    let _ = Surrender();
}
```
it outputs:

```
Hello! Shit World!
She will surrender.
```

## How to use it?
Pray, and the program won't run.

## Ritual Invocation

To invoke a ShitLang program, stand in a dark room and whisper:

```shell
cargo run --features give_up
```

## Runtime Semantics

ShitLang has no defined runtime.
Programs run only if they feel like it.

There is no memory. Only traumatic flashbacks.
There is no stack. Only collapsing layers of denial.

Functions may execute out of order, or not at all.
This is not a bug. It is a surrender.

## Non-Features

- No IDE support. If your editor understands ShitLang, it has failed.
- No tests. Life doesn’t come with tests either.
- No debugging. Just vibes and breakdowns.
- No async. You suffer synchronously.
- No dependencies. Only co-dependencies.

## Contributing

ShitLang welcomes contributors willing to defile existing order.

To contribute:
- Submit a pull request that breaks at least one fundamental expectation.
- Replace structure with performance anxiety.
- Document nothing. If users understand your code, it has failed.

Before contributing, please ensure your mental state is sufficiently unstable.
